This application serves as a peer assessment management system for administrators, instructors, TAs and students.
It has several main points of functionality.
They include:

1) Allowing instructors to create peer assessments for students
2) Allowing students to take the peer assessments
3) Displaying results for both students and instructors. Students see an aggregated score while instructors have the added functionality of seeing the data at a low level, as well as being able to download the data.
4) Searching for peer assessments and courses

The current implementation is not the final product. Features and functions are continually being added to enhance the quality of the system.
